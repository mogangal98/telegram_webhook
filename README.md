This code is a Telegram webhook that manages a 
Telegram bot for viewing open positions and orders on a shared
Binance account used for algorithmic trading. 
The bot allows multiple people to monitor the account without needing passwords or login 
credentials. In the original version, there are additional features for opening and closing 
positions, some details about the algorithm, but these are excluded here. Sensitive information, 
such as API keys and other proprietary details, has been removed from this version.
